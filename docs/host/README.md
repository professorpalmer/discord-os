# Host

The host is the long-running process on this Mac: listen loop, JobPool, SQLite, Puppetmaster workers. Discord is only the remote.

`discord-os setup` / `host start` detaches it and posts the HOST card: On, Off, Ask, a More menu (Pair / Halt / Gate / Roles / GitHub / Files here or on host / Terminal on host / Browser here or on host), and Jobs. Dest is a noun: **here** stays in Discord (the tapping client — phone or desktop — opens the link or reads the listing). **host** opens a GUI on the listen machine. Discord does not send which client tapped; presence `client_status` is not a dest. The job line and select are a deterministic briefing over SQLite: parked / failed first, then live, then last Done. Not a second board. Message intake is REST. A Gateway is open **only** so those controls work. Do not run a second bot process on the same token. Discord has no tabs — the More select is the grouping.

## Power

| Discord | Meaning |
|---|---|
| On | Armed. First click may become owner. |
| Off → Confirm | Disarmed. Helper stays so On still works. |
| Ask | Prompt into that channel. |
| Pair | Owner / operators. |
| Halt | Spend cap. `discord-os spend --resume` clears it. |

Work is accepted only while On, and only from a paired operator after the first pair.

## Login helper

macOS LaunchAgent (`com.discord-os.host`) or the Windows equivalent from `host/install.py`. After a PyPI bump, install into that venv and kick the helper.

```bash
discord-os host status
discord-os host stop
discord-os host start --channel-id ID
```

## Other host verbs

- `/open [here|host] terminal|files|browser` — dest-explicit. `here` lists files or returns a link in Discord. `host` opens a GUI. Browser with a URL defaults to here.
- `schedule every 1h: run tests` — SQLite cron, listen loop fires it
- voice memo — local whisper CLI if on PATH
