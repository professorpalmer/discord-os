# Discord OS

Discord is the screen. This process is the computer. Your phone is the remote.

SQLite is the database. Two threads cook at once. Puppetmaster runs on this Mac. Artifacts are Discord snowflakes plus sha256. Intake is REST. No hosted fleet.

```bash
pip install discord-os
```

Leave the host running. Turn work on and off from Discord.

Workers need [Puppetmaster](https://pypi.org/project/puppetmaster-ai/) too:

```bash
pip install discord-os puppetmaster-ai
```

The `agent-discord` command still works. Full setup, Discord verbs, and docs live in the repo — PyPI does not host those pages.

## First run

Once, in a browser: [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) → New Application → **Bot** → Reset Token (`DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`) → enable **Message Content Intent** → General Information → Application ID (`DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID`). Copy a private channel ID.

Then on the machine that will do the work (Python 3.11+):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install discord-os puppetmaster-ai
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...      # never commit
discord-os bootstrap
# put DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN and DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID in .env
discord-os setup --channel-id YOUR_CHANNEL_ID
```

Open the invite URL, press **On**. After that, `discord-os add` and in-channel `bind` — not a wizard. See [docs/setup](https://github.com/professorpalmer/discord-os/blob/master/docs/setup/README.md).
